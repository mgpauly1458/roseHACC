# Alaka'i Trail Directory
A web application designed to promote sustainable and responsible trail use within Hawaii's hiking community. It also allows state officials and the general public to monitor foot-traffic density on any of Hawaii's hiking trails. This application was made using Django, React, Tailwind CSS, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Twilio, Stripe, RabbitMQ, and Heroku.

# Overview
Trails are overburdened by congestion, and hikers are often unaware of proper trail etiquette and information. This poses a risk to the wellbeing of trail ecosystems, and a safety risk to hikers themselves. Alaka’i offers a variety of features to provide hikers with reliable and accurate information, along with the ability to reverse trail damage through donations.

# Reservations
Our reservation feature provides a solution to overburdened trails by aligning the interests of hikers and the state
Nobody enjoys hiking on busy trails. When reservations are made, our color indicators update and hikers are made aware of when other users plan to hike. Naturally, hikers will make reservations at less busy times reducing traffic without strict state enforcement.
